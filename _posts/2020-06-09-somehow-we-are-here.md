I know you probably thinking this is kind of weird. After all these years of saying: "Hi my name is Odd." And your response that would goes like: "Hi, you Odd? I think you are totally fine. Actually I think you are kind of cute." Yeah right! And that smirky smile kind of response that would have changed me forever.

At first I was kind of thinking yeah right and you were kind of cool. The accent, the move, the way you were trying to describe things ... and there came your smirky smile and finally that kind of nice and warm gentle smell. And I was like kind of was pulled to you a bit closer. Yeah right and that kind of hangout things that came after.

The movie was great but the parties were more kind of fun. But for starbucks, I would say that was definitely awesome. It was like you are kind of coffee lover and I was like wanna try just to had a sip. And then at that one time you said: "Would it be nicer if you taste it from my lips instead of taste it from my cup?" ... Yeah that was definitely way more sexier when you said that.

Then we were steady and sort of happy in that very little space that we were sort of cocooning for a little while. And then came this one time when you said that it was kind of a deja Vu ... and your face was like u-hoo! Were we like on the same page here? And that was kind of like started to crack this relationship that was like so kind of freaky fragile, in some how or some way.

I know these memories they were scrappy and way kind of grey, old and fading out. But somehow ...
